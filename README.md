# I Ching Reference Chart for AI Learning

This project contains a structured CSV chart representing the 64 hexagrams of the **I Ching (Book of Changes)**—a foundational text of Chinese philosophy, cosmology, and moral inquiry. The chart is designed to support **symbolic reasoning**, **ethical decision-making**, and **spiritual reflection** in artificial intelligence and related research.

## About the Chart

The CSV file organizes each of the 64 hexagrams with key symbolic elements including:

- Hexagram number and name  
- Trigram components (upper and lower)  
- Binary representation  
- Classical text (Judgment, Image, and/or Line Statements)  
- Cross-references to changing lines and associated transformations (if included)

The format is designed for easy parsing by machines while retaining the poetic and philosophical depth necessary for human-aligned AI learning.

## Purpose

This chart was created as part of a broader inquiry into how ancient wisdom traditions can inform the design of more **contemplative, context-aware, and ethically grounded AI systems**. It may be used for:

- Training datasets in symbolic AI or moral logic  
- Teaching tools for Eastern philosophy, Taoism, or comparative systems  
- Human–AI dialogue design  
- Art, writing, or meditative reflection
